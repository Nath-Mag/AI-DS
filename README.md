## üìÅ Contents

### 1. üìä Census Data Analysis
A comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of census data, involving:
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Summary statistics
- Data visualisation using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Skills: Pandas, data wrangling, visualisation

**Notebook:** `DS_Census_Project.ipynb`

---

### 2. üî¢ MNIST Digit Classification
A foundational deep learning project using TensorFlow/Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset:
- Neural network model training
- Performance evaluation with confusion matrix and classification report
- Visualisation of predictions

**Notebook:** `MNIST_Digit_Classification.ipynb`

### 3. üí¨ Sentiment Analysis: Traditional vs Deep Learning
This project compares traditional ML and deep learning models for binary sentiment classification using the IMDB movie review dataset:
- Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes (TF-IDF)
- LSTM and GRU with GloVe embeddings
- Evaluation using accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall

**Notebook:** `Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb`

| Model               | Accuracy | Avg F1-Score |
|--------------------|----------|--------------|
| Logistic Regression| 89%      | 89.5%        |
| Na√Øve Bayes        | 88%      | 88%          |
| LSTM + GloVe       | 88%      | 87.5%        |
| GRU + GloVe        | 88%      | 88%          |
